# Activity-3-Algorithms
## What does this code do?
### Generates a random DAG with N tasks and M dependencies (e.g., edges between tasks).
### Implements Topological Sorting using Depth First Search (DFS) to determine the task order.
### Simulates the sorting process step-by-step, showing the tasks being processed in each iteration.
## Handles exceptions for:
### Cyclic dependencies in the graph.
### Invalid data types during graph generation or sorting.
### Allow the user to specify the number of tasks N and dependencies M to generate.
